### Ernesto L. Garcia C., PhD.

*"Experienced practitioner able to understand the challenge and business context, choose the right technology and deliver solutions leading teams, being part of a team, or individually. Engineer with mastery of statistics and linear algebra to approach problems with rigor and mathematical superiority; Machine Learning technologies to achieve modeling performance; Analytics acumen to focus on the important rather than the interesting; and Storytelling to translate complex results into practical decisions."*

### 1. [Market Segmentation using RFM and Cluster Analysis](https://github.com/elgc/Market_Segmentation)
**(Topics:Data Science, Marketing)**

-**Situation:** The marketing function of a company wanted to perform a customer segmentation of its customers using a RFM algorithm. The data (reduced, scaled and transformed to provide anonymity) consists of 594,783 purchasing entries with three columns: *Date*, *Client*, and *Sale* value. 

The following definition of terms are important"

- *Customer segmentation* is the process of dividing a market into sub-groups of clients based on some type of shared characteristics.
- *RFM* stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (Sales in this example).
- 
- **Objective:** Segment clients based on when their last purchase was (Recency), how often they’ve purchased in the past (Frequency), and how much they’ve spent overall (Sales). 
- In general, these measures are effective predictors of a customer's willingness to engage in marketing messages and offers.
- **Task: Cluster analysis**: ML tech used to group similar objects into respective categories. It is also known as segmentation analysis, taxonomy analysis, or clustering. 
- **Output:** Once these groups were clearly defined, a marketing team could target clients with specific strategies and increase profits.

### 2. [A3 and TBP for Process Improvement](https://github.com/elgc/Portfolio/blob/main/A3TBP_Appaloosa.pdf)
**(Lean-Six Sigma, Logistics, Sustainable defect reduction)** <br/>

- **Short paper** on the use of the **A3/TBP methodology** for sustainable and dramatic process improvement. 
- **Objective:** Comunicate that any transformational project needs to be explored and observed in the *"place where the action is."* The term for exploring and observing a process is called **Genchi Genbutsu**.
- **Caveat:** Through each step of the A3 methodology I have used baseball quotes. When I sent the first draft for feedback some of my colleagues from overseas replied that they were not able to understand the quotes due to their lack of familiarity with baseball. A future case, with soccer references :), is on the way.
- **Output**: Zero defects in a record number of shipments.

### 3. [Classifiers improving human appraisers evaluation](https://github.com/elgc/Other-Classifiers)
**(Data Science)**

[KNN](https://github.com/elgc/Other-Classifiers/blob/main/KNN-Sonar%20Data.ipynb)

[SVM with linear kernel](https://github.com/elgc/Other-Classifiers/blob/main/Sonar%20Data%20with%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Linear%20kernel.ipynb)

[SVM with radial kernel](https://github.com/elgc/Other-Classifiers/blob/main/Sonar%20Data%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20Radial%20Kernel.ipynb)

[Binary logistic regression](https://github.com/elgc/Other-Classifiers/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression-Sonar%20Data.ipynb)


- **Objective:** Provide better performance than human inspectors in the detection of submarine mines. 
- **Baseline:** Three trained human subjects detected **88% to 97%** of the mines. However, they may have been using information from the raw sonar signal that is not preserved in the processed data sets presented here.
- **Output:** One of the models detected **98.1%** of the mines at higher speed and lower cost.

### 4. [Overland Move Planning for Intermodal Logistics with Order Uncertainty](https://github.com/elgc/Portfolio/blob/main/iie-presentation.pdf)
**(Operations Research, Logistics)**

- **Objective:** Describing the mathematical model and systems architecture to minimize the transportation of empty containers for a logistics company.
- Presented at ISERC 2013, Puerto Rico.
- **Output:** Proof of concept for future selection of best commercial solution.
- This proof of concept was developed with faculty and PhD students from the University of Florida.

### 5. [Operating profit maximization for Ship Assist & Escort](https://github.com/elgc/Portfolio/blob/main/Profit%20maximization%20project%20for%20Ship%20Assist.pdf)

**(Marketing/Sales, Mix Modeling and Optimization, Simulation, Random Forest Regression, Maritime)**

- **Objective:** Increase the operating profit of a Ship Assist & Escort company in the West coast.
- Presented at the 2020 Lean & Six Sigma World Conference.
- **Output:** Portfolio Mix with a positive shift of 11 percent in operating margin.
- This project was jointly developed with one heck of a good industrial engineer: Mr. Rami Mouad.

### 6. [Forecasting Health Insurance Costs](https://github.com/elgc/Insurance-costs-predictor)
**(Data Science, Health Insurance)***

- **Objective:** Develop a simple model to estimate the cost of health insurance as a function of variables considered under control of the individual.
- **Output:** Two models: A Random Forest Tree model with Hyperparameter Optimization using random search and a Random Forest with Boosting (CatBoost) with grid search provided the best predictability with **R2=0.87** on test data.
- Different approaches were evaluated and are in the repository: Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forests, Boosting (CatBoost), Hyperparameter Optimization (random search, grid search) Polynomial Regression.
