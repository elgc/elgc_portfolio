This is a short paper on the use of the A3/TBP methodology for process improvement. Also, it tries to convey the message that any transformational project needs to be explored and observed in the "place where the action is." The term for exploring and observing a process is called Genchi Genbutsu.

Some of my friends from overseas are not familiar with baseball quotes. A future case with soccer references is on the way. Best regards.
