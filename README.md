### [A3 and TBP for Process Improvement](https://github.com/elgc/Portfolio/blob/main/A3TBP_Appaloosa.pdf)
**(Process improvement, Lean, Six Sigma)** <br/>
This is a short paper on the use of the A3/TBP methodology for process improvement. Also, it tries to convey the message that any transformational project needs to be explored and observed in the "place where the action is." The term for exploring and observing a process is called Genchi Genbutsu.

Some of my friends from overseas are not familiar with baseball quotes. A future case with soccer references is on the way. Best regards.

### Classifiers improving human appraisers benchmark:

Four simple classifiers are used to provide better performance than human inspectors in the detection of submarine mines. The data is as follows:

File with 1) Bouncing sonar signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various conditions, and 2) from bouncing sonar signals off rocks under similar conditions. The transmitted sonar signal is a frequency-modulated chirp, rising in frequency. The data set contains signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles, spanning 90 degrees for the cylinder and 180 degrees for the rock.

Each pattern is a set of 60 features in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Each feature representing the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.

The label associated with each record contains "Rock" or "Mine".

Three trained human subjects were each tested on 100 signals, chosen at random from the set of 208 returns used to create this data set. Their responses ranged between **88% and 97% correct**. However, they may have been using information from the raw sonar signal that is not preserved in the processed data sets presented here.
